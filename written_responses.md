1. Describe the general process of how blocks are added to a blockchain.

   > The general process of how blocks are added is through hashing. So every block will contain a timestamp, a list of transactions and the has of the previous block. Once it creates the new block that is when the data is hashed and stored in that block which will chain them together.

2. How can blockchain users mine coins?

   > To mine coins from block chains is for a user to validate new transactions and record them on a global ledger. Only if that transaction is valid and a new Block is created and added to the chain. This is when a miner will receive their coin.

3. Explain how simulations like Conway's Game of Life can be used in real-world applications.
   > There could be a use of simulating plane or flight travel using conways Game of life. I also just thinking that if conways game of life could also predict other planets. The simulation is based and simple rules which is the same thing with look for in other planets. Or in space travel. Using the building blocks of what Conways Game of Life gives us I think a great simulation is with all the factors we have to have 3 or more planets circulating the a hot star (Sun). And has possible % of this or that. Then we could use it to find other planets such as earth.
